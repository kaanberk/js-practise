    Notes : 

- Variable names can begin with letter, or the symbols $ or _. They can only contain letters, numbers, $ and _. 
  They cannot begin with a number. "myVarable", "leaf_1", and "$money3" are all examples of valud variable names.

  var $_na8me = "Adam";

- Variable names are case sensitive, which means that"xPos" is different from "xpos", so make sure you are consistent.

  var firstname = "Adam";
  console.log(firstNAME); -> error

- Variable names should use camel case for multiple words, like "toothSize" instead of "tootsize" or "tooth_size".

  var ninumberofemployee = 1234451
  var NInumberOfEmployee = 1234451

- variable cannot be any of Javascripst's reserved words or keywords.
